It’s rare and helpful to see how a production-grade coding agent is built and shipped at scale. I noticed [the updated contribution guide limits PRs from outside OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/codex/discussions/9956), but the ability to read the code and join the discussion is still incredibly valuable.\n\nPersonally, I love using the Rust-written codex-cli, and I really appreciate the Codex team’s technical taste. At the same time, the real moat is the GPT model itself. Open-sourcing more of the agent/UI layer wouldn’t meaningfully undermine OpenAI’s competitiveness, if anything, it could bring more community feedback and faster iteration.\n\nWith that in mind, would you consider open-sourcing the Codex App as well? From the outside, it's just a Electron codex-cli wrapper, and open-sourcing it would offer the same kind of learning and community feedback.\n\n### What steps can reproduce the bug?\n\nNA\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nCodex App is open source.\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

Shell users expect `Ctrl+R` to open an interactive reverse-search and quickly\ninsert a previous command; bringing this to the composer makes prompt iteration much faster than\nrepeated Up/Down navigation.\n\n## UX / behavior\n### Entering search\n- Press `Ctrl+R` in the composer:\n  - Opens a “History search” popup.\n  - Captures the current draft so it can be restored on cancel:\n    - text, text elements, local image paths\n    - mention targets\n    - pending large-paste payloads\n    - cursor position\n  - Starts fetching persistent history entries on-demand (bounded, see below).\n\n### While search is open\n- Query editing (affects *search query* only):\n  - Type plain characters → append to query\n  - `Backspace` → delete last character\n  - `Ctrl+W` → delete previous “word” (whitespace-delimited)\n  - `Ctrl+U` → clear query\n  - Paste text → appended to query (newlines treated as spaces)\n- Navigation:\n  - `Up` / `Ctrl+P` → move selection up (wrap)\n  - `Down` / `Ctrl+N` → move selection down (wrap)\n  - `Ctrl+R` → also moves selection up (older match)\n- Accept / cancel:\n  - `Enter` → accept selection and insert into composer\n  - `Esc` → cancel and restore captured draft exactly\n\n### Preview\n- The composer textarea previews the currently selected match while the popup is open.\n\n## Matching / ranking\n- Fuzzy match: `codex_common::fuzzy_match::fuzzy_match` (case-insensitive subsequence).\n- Scope:\n  - In-session submissions (full fidelity: text + elements + attachments).\n  - Cross-session persistent history (text-only).\n- Ranking:\n  - Primary: fuzzy score (lower is better).\n  - Tie-break: recency (newer first).\n\n## Persistent history fetching (no protocol changes)\nUses existing request/response:\n- `Op::GetHistoryEntryRequest { log_id, offset }`\n- `GetHistoryEntryResponseEvent { log_id, offset, entry }`\n\nBounded prefetch while searching:\n- `HISTORY_SEARCH_MAX_PERSISTENT_SCAN = 500`\n- `HISTORY_SEARCH_MAX_IN_FLIGHT = 8`\n- `HISTORY_SEARCH_TARGET_MATCHES = 200`\n\n## Edge cases / expectations\n- Empty history → popup shows “no matches”.\n- Multi-line history entry → display first line + ellipsis.\n- Cancel restores draft including:\n  - attachments\n  - mention link targets\n  - pending large-paste placeholder payloads\n  - cursor position\n\n## Implementation notes\n- Adds a new popup variant to the composer’s popup state machine:\n  - `ActivePopup::HistorySearch`\n- Adds a dedicated popup UI component:\n  - `codex-rs/tui/src/bottom_pane/history_search_popup.rs`\n- Reuses `ChatComposerHistory` caches + existing persistent history lookup ops.\n- Prevents other popups (slash/file/skill) from stealing focus while history-search is active.\n- Updates the shortcut overlay to include `Ctrl+R`.\n- Updates `docs/tui-chat-composer.md` with the new behavior.\n\n## Tests / validation\n- Unit tests in `codex-rs/tui/src/bottom_pane/chat_composer.rs` for:\n  - opening search + previewing latest match\n  - filtering by query + accepting with Enter\n  - cancel restoring draft + pending pastes\n  - prefetch issuing expected `GetHistoryEntryRequest` ops when persistent history exists\n- Snapshot updates for footer shortcut overlay.\n- Commands run:\n  - `just fmt`\n  - `cargo test -p codex-tui`\n\n\n\n### Additional information\n[diff-patch.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/25090390/diff-patch.txt)",

After rolling back to 0.96.0, the issue is gone.\n\n### What steps can reproduce the bug?\n\nRun the planner mode, let it plan something and ask for permission to implement it, try to scroll up -> It will always scroll down to\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nScrolling is possible while the CLI is idle.\n\n### Additional information\n\nI use WSL with Ubuntu.",

        "body": "## Problem\n\nThe Codex macOS app does not display reasoning summaries or thinking blocks during model execution. When the model is thinking, the UI shows nothing until the final answer appears, which makes the app feel unresponsive. Other Codex tools such as the CLI and IDE render reasoning summaries, and there are configuration flags (`model_reasoning_summary`, `hide_agent_reasoning`, `show_raw_agent_reasoning`) documented to control reasoning visibility.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Install the latest Codex macOS app (observed on the build current as of 2026‑02‑05).\n2. Launch a new conversation and ask a non‑trivial question.\n3. Observe that during long thinking, the app does not stream reasoning summaries or display thinking blocks.\n4. Edit `~/.codex/config.toml` and add:\n   ```toml\n   model_reasoning_summary = \"detailed\"\n   hide_agent_reasoning = false\n   show_raw_agent_reasoning = true\n   ```\n   then restart the app.\n5. Observe that the app still does not display reasoning summaries.\n\n## Expected behavior\n\nThe Codex macOS app should either:\n* Display reasoning summaries in the main chat view like the CLI/IDE does. The CLI issue #8204 proposes flushing reasoning summaries incrementally and showing them by default【902190394343352†L242-L254】.\n* Or provide a user-visible setting to toggle reasoning summaries and respect `model_reasoning_summary`, `hide_agent_reasoning`, and `show_raw_agent_reasoning` configuration flags.\n\n## Related issues\n\nThe CLI/TUI has existing tickets about reasoning summary visibility and configuration flags not being respected【405976122463457†L240-L269】. Those issues confirm that users want control over reasoning visibility. This request is specifically for the macOS app, which currently lacks any UI to display these summaries or to configure them.\n\n## Environment\n\n* Codex macOS app version: latest as of 2026‑02‑05 (Codex CLI 0.97.0)\n* Model: gpt‑5.2‑codex\n* Platform: macOS (Apple Silicon)\n\nThanks for considering adding this capability to improve perceived responsiveness and feature parity with other Codex tools.\n",

This happens when the session is already a local git worktree but is in **detached HEAD**. It’s unclear whether this is expected or a UI bug, but it’s confusing for users who start from main and expect to attach/create a branch.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Start a Codex desktop app conversation from a repo on main.\n2. Use/enter a local git worktree for the conversation.\n3. Ensure the worktree is in detached HEAD (git branch --show-current returns empty).\n4. Observe the worktree UI actions.\n\n## Expected\nShow **Create branch here** (or an explicit action to attach the worktree to a branch), or indicate why it’s hidden in detached HEAD state.\n\n## Actual\nOnly **Hand off to local** is shown.\n\n## Environment\n- Codex Desktop App version: 260204.1342 (CFBundleVersion 531)\n- macOS: 26.2 (Build 25C56)\n- Repo state: local git worktree, detached HEAD\n- git branch --show-current: (empty)\n- git rev-parse --short HEAD: 5b637aa\n\n## Notes\nI will add screenshots in a follow-up comment.\n\n<img width=\"1083\" height=\"315\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d206bfdc-fd3a-4ad8-bbf5-a3d448455632\" />\n\n<img width=\"1414\" height=\"1025\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/504648bf-ff78-4f71-85dc-e11613257b61\" />\n\n<img width=\"404\" height=\"92\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecf33948-121e-4fb7-b150-3e48089e8249\" />\n",

        "body": "## Problem\nThe first user message currently pays websocket setup latency when Responses websocket transport is enabled. We want to reduce that startup delay while preserving turn semantics, especially that no user prompt is sent before the user submits one.\n\n## Mental model\n`ModelClient` owns session-scoped transport state and now has a single preconnect slot for a warmed websocket. Session startup opportunistically warms that socket in the background. The first turn's `ModelClientSession` tries to adopt it, but only when connection-scoped header inputs match (`x-oai-web-search-eligible` and `x-codex-turn-metadata`). If they do not match, the warmed socket is discarded and a fresh websocket is opened for that turn.\n\n## Non-goals\nThis change does not send any initial `response.create` during preconnect. It does not make preconnect required for correctness; preconnect is best-effort and turn execution still works without it. It also does not change the existing HTTP fallback behavior beyond ensuring stale preconnect state is cleared when fallback is activated.\n\n## Tradeoffs\nThe design favors correctness over reuse rate: strict header matching may miss reuse opportunities, but avoids adopting a socket initialized with incompatible turn assumptions. A single-slot cache keeps ownership simple and prevents accidental multi-turn sharing, but means only the immediate next matching turn can benefit.\n\n## Architecture\nSession creation (`Session::new`) computes the first-turn web-search eligibility and asynchronously builds turn metadata (bounded by a short timeout), then calls `ModelClient::preconnect`. `ModelClient::preconnect` performs only websocket handshake setup, captures optional turn-state for sticky routing, and stores a `PreconnectedWebSocket` in session state. At stream time, `ModelClientSession::websocket_connection` tries to consume that slot via `try_use_preconnected_websocket`; otherwise it opens a new websocket. Fallback activation clears live websocket state and the preconnect slot.\n\n## Observability\nPreconnect failures are treated as non-fatal and logged at debug level. Existing fallback telemetry (`codex.transport.fallback_to_http`) remains in place. Test coverage verifies externally observable behavior: startup handshake occurs before first submit, no prompt is sent during mismatched preconnect reuse attempt, and the first prompt is sent only on turn submit.\n\n## Tests\n- `cargo test -p codex-core --test all preconnect`\n- `cargo test -p codex-core --test all websocket_fallback`\n- `cargo test -p codex-core`\n\nAdditionally, this PR includes focused tests for:\n- startup preconnect handshake before first turn\n- reuse when connection-scoped headers match\n- fresh connection when headers mismatch\n- fallback attempt-count expectations with preconnect enabled\n",

This makes it easy to compare against the wrong remote (e.g., `origin/main` instead of `upstream/main`), leading to incorrect diffs and review findings.\n\n**Update**\n\nI thought to work around the ambiguity by renaming the default branch of my fork to my username, and now I can't see the main branch on the upstream repo at all.\n\n<img width=\"747\" height=\"74\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/975e2690-b69f-4cb9-809e-efeb0ea54116\" />\n\n### Impact\nReviews can be performed against the wrong base branch without any warning or disambiguation.\n\n\n### What steps can reproduce the bug?\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open a Git repo with two remotes, both having a `main` branch (e.g., `origin/main` and `upstream/main`).\n2. Start a Codex review and pick “main” as the base branch from the selector.\n3. Observe that the selector does not show the remote name, and the review compares against an unintended `main`.\n\n### Evidence\n- Screenshot of the base branch selector (attached).\n\n<img width=\"1486\" height=\"502\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09ccb94f-8a3d-401e-9828-262ad043ec18\" />\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nThe base branch selector should disambiguate remotes, e.g., showing `origin/main` and `upstream/main`, or provide a way to choose the remote explicitly. The review should honor the exact remote the user intended.\n\n\n### Additional information\n\nReport drafted by Codex based on user-provided screenshots and repro steps.\n",
